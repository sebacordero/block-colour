# The Bitcoin Color of the Block (block-colour)

This idea was motivated by this tweet: https://twitter.com/moon33_blue/status/1663274907701002271?s=20

To start, the index should show the number of the last block minned using the information provided by https://blockstream.info using the API. This can be checked on https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md

Next, adding a hashtag (#) before the number of the last block minned, should be useful as an hexadecimal form of representing colours, colorHexa :)

With this colorHexa we can change the background of the number of the last block minned and will be a dynamic change of the colour each time a new Bitcoin block is minned :)
